# Credit Risk Probability of Default (PD) Model

This project replicates part of a **Quantitative Research internship simulation (J.P. Morgan Forage)**.  
It develops a predictive **Probability of Default (PD)** model and a **FICO-based credit rating bucketer**, 
using real-world-style loan data and modern data-science tools.

## 📊 Project Overview

**Objective:**  
Estimate borrower default probability and group borrowers into discrete credit-rating buckets for risk assessment.

**Key Techniques:**
- Logistic regression for PD estimation  
- FICO-score bucketing via 1-D *k-means* (minimizing MSE)  
- Visualization of borrower distribution and default probability  
- Clean modular code organized for reproducibility
