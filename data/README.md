## Data Folder

This folder contains the private dataset used for model training and FICO bucketing.

**Files:**
- `Loan_Data.csv` — sample loan book with borrower attributes and default flags.
- `fico_boundaries_mse.json` — saved bucket boundaries (auto-generated).

Note: `Loan_Data.csv` is **not tracked in GitHub** for privacy reasons. Place it manually here before running any scripts.
